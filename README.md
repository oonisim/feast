# Feast Getting Started
Based on the quickstart guide on Feast's website (http://docs.feast.dev/quickstart).

A quick view of what's in this repository's `feature_repository/` directory:

* `data/` contains raw demo parquet data
* `feature_repository/define_features.py` contains the feature definitions
* `feature_repository/feature_store.yaml` contains the FEAST configuration.`
